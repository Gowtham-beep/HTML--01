            <summary>When Was The Taco invented?</summary>
            <p class="about__trivia-answer">
              Mexican historian Jeffrey M. Pilcher's theory, which has some more
              evidence to support it, is that the dish started around the 18th
              century in Mexican silver mines. He suggests this because the
              sticks of dynamite used in the mining process were referred to as
              “tacos” and had a shape similar to the dish we eat today.
